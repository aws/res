**BUG FIXES**

- Fixed a bug where RES Users were given the option to create FSx for Lustre file systems through the UI. RES only supports mounting existing file systems. To create an FSx for Lustre file system see https://docs.aws.amazon.com/fsx/latest/LustreGuide/getting-started.html#getting-started-step1
- Resolved an issue with the IAMPermissionBoundary parameter that prevented the use of GovCloud ARNs.
- Resolved an issue that caused failures when deleting a RES environment in GovCloud.
- Resolved an issue preventing RES installation for accounts with GuardDuty Runtime Monitoring for AWS Fargate enabled.

**ENHANCEMENTS**

- Added support for onboarding FSx for Lustre file systems onto RHEL 9 kernel version 5.14.0-362*.

2024.04.01
------

**BUG FIXES**

- Fixed an issue where Admin users outside the sudoers group were not granted sudo permissions on Linux virtual desktops when DisableADJoin was set to True.
- Resolved an issue that prevented RES infrastructure hosts and Linux virtual desktops from automatically recovering after unexpected reboots during instance warm-up.

2024.04
------

**ENHANCEMENTS**

- Add support for RES Ready AMI.
  - Improve VDI boot times by installing all necessary software in the AMI instead of installing it at EC2 instance launch. This also allows VDIs to run in private subnets with no internet access.
- Add QUIC support for VDIs.
  - The QUIC protocol has better streaming performance in high latency environments. Administrators can toggle this for all VDIs under Session Management → Desktop Settings → General → QUIC.
- Add support for custom VDI Instance launch parameters.
  - Launch parameters include additional IAM policies, security groups and launch scripts. Add these configurations under Advanced Options when creating or editing a project. The settings will apply to all VDIs launched for that project.
- Add support for IAM Permission boundaries.
  - Customers can now specify a permission boundary that will be added to all IAM roles created by the RES environment.
- Add support for deploying RES in an isolated VPC.
- Add support for encrypting communications between RES and AD via LDAPS.
- Add FSx Lustre as a storage option in RES.
- Add support for the Israel (Tel Aviv) region.
- Remove required creation of additional VPC during installation.
- Reduce idle costs.
  - Reduced instance size of some infrastructure instances to reduce base cost of running RES.

**BUG FIXES**

- Add support to auto renew Let’s Encrypt certificates.

2024.01.01
------

**BUG FIXES**

- Upgraded CDK Lambda runtime to nodejs18.x

2024.01
------

**ENHANCEMENTS**

- Add support for snapshots that enable migration between versions of RES.
  - The migration process involves taking a snapshot, deploying the new version (e.g. 2024.01) and applying the snapshot from the previous version (e.g. 2023.11) on the new version. Allows for admins to confirm the new version works before transferring users.
- Add support for private subnets.
  - Enable deployments of RES infrastructure hosts in private subnets with internet access.
  - RES infrastructure hosts refer to the Cluster Manager, Bastion Host, VDC Gateway, VDC Controller, and VDC Broker.
- Deprecation of the analytics stack.
  - Removed required OpenSearch dependency.
  - Reduces RES environment deployment and deletion time by approximately 30 minutes.
- Add support for use of custom Amazon Linux 2 EC2 AMI for RES infrastructure hosts.
  - Enable specifying an AL2 EC2 AMI use for RES infrastructure hosts for users that require specific software or updates installed on their hosts.
  - RES infrastructure hosts refer to the Cluster Manager, Bastion Host, VDC Gateway, VDC Controller, and VDC Broker.
- Add support for ldap_id_mapping “True” in SSSD.
  - Previously the AD sync code required the groups and users to have POSIX attributes uidNumber and gidNumber in order to sync with RES. This conflicted with the IDs generated by SSSD, potentially causing RES users to not be able to access filesystems if they were using SSSD with other systems (e.g. ParallelCluster) .
- Add support for four new regions Asia Pacific (Tokyo), Asia Pacific (Seoul), Canada (Central), Europe (Milan).
- Add ability to add users to projects. Previously only groups could be added to project permissions.

**BUG FIXES**

- Added validation for FSx ONTAP filesystem creation
- Narrowed installation IAM permissions
- Skipped deletion of batteries included related resources
- VDI no longer tries to mount filesystems after removing filesystem from project
