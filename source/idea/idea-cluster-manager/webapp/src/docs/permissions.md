## Permission policy
The default environment policy can be modified and customized to align with the organization's policy and requirements.

### Environment boundaries
The environment boundaries define the maximum allowed permissions.

**Note:** Permissions enabled in Environment boundaries can be modified in project roles or desktop sharing profiles. However, permissions disabled in boundaries are _Disabled globally_ and cannot be re-enabled in roles or profiles.

### Project roles
Project roles control user access and actions within projects.

### Desktop sharing profiles
Desktop sharing profiles control user access on shared desktops. Sharing profiles grant at most only subsets of the permissions enabled to desktop owners in Environment boundaries.
