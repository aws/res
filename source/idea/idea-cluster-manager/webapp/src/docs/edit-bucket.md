## Edit bucket

Edit your onboarded S3 bucket in Research and Engineering Studio (RES).

### Bucket setup

You may provide a new name for the bucket display name.

### Project association

Associate the bucket with projects in Research and Engineering Studio (RES). You can create new projects on the Projects page found under the Environment Management section of Research and Engineering Studio (RES).

Note that buckets will not automatically mount to already provisioned VDI sessions. Associate a bucket with a project prior to launching VDIs in that project.

Dissassociating a bucket from a project will not impact the data in the S3 bucket, but will result in desktop users in that project losing access to the bucket's data.

### Additional information

For additional information, see the [S3 buckets](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/res/latest/ug/S3-buckets.html) section in the official AWS documentation for Research and Engineering Studio (RES).
