    <summary markdown="span"><b>Configure schedule</b></summary>

Setup a schedule to start/stop your virtual desktop to save and manage costs.

> **Note:** Virtual Desktop will only be stopped if there is no active DCV client connected for 2 hours and the overall CPU usage is below a certain threshold. Idle time/CPU threshold are configurable by Admins. This measure is meant to prevent Virtual Desktop to be accidentally stopped while running simulations.

-   **No Schedule**: Virtual Desktop lifecycle are managed by the user. Active session will run until you manually stop/terminate it. Stopped session will stay stopped until you manually start it. This is the default scheduling mode
-   **Working Hours**: RES will automatically start your session in the morning and stop it if inactive in the evening. Hours can be configured by RES admins
-   **Stop All Days**: Enforce session to be stopped all day. If you manually start your session, RES will automatically stop it after the idle period configured by admins
-   **Start All Days**: Enforce session to be started all day. If you manually stop your session, RES will automatically start it.
-   **Custom Schedule**: User defines when the session must be started/stopped
